          Café Coffee Day (CCD) is an Indian multinational chain of coffee
          houses headquartered in Bengaluru, Karnataka. It is a subsidiary of
          Coffee Day Enterprises Limited. Internationally, CCDs are present in
          Austria, Czech Republic, Malaysia, Nepal and Egypt. Café Coffee Day
          Global Limited Company is a Chikkamagaluru-based business which grows
          coffee in its own estates of 20,000 acres.[5] It is the largest
          producer of arabica beans in Asia, exporting to various countries
          including U.S., Europe, and Japan.[6] V. G. Siddhartha started the
          café chain in 1996 when he incorporated Coffee Day Global, which is
          the parent of the Coffee Day chain.[7] The first CCD outlet was set up
          on July 11, 1996, at Brigade Road, Bangalore, Karnataka. It rapidly
          expanded to other cities in India, with more than 1,000 cafés open
          across the nation by 2011. In 2010, it was announced that a consortium
          led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts would invest ₹1,000 crore (equivalent
          to ₹19 billion or US$240 million in 2020) in Coffee Day Resorts, owned
          by the company.[8] The same year, the logo was changed to the current
          logo, which the company stated was to showcase the chain as a place to
          talk.[9] This was done with major changes in the layout of the stores,
          including the addition of lounges and a total revamp of the interiors.
